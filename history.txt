
RoBoIO v1.9 (2013/3/12)
=========================

  + the license of the RoBoIO library is now defined as the MIT license: 

        http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

  + [by AAA] add rcservo_InitP() and rcservo_PinMode() to simplify the 
    initialization of the RC Servo lib. See the section of RC Servo lib in 
    RoBoIO introduction slides for details.
    
  + [by AAA] add rcservo_PlayActionS() to perform sine interpolation (the usage 
    of the function is the same as rcservo_PlayAction()).

  + [by AAA] add roboio_Delay() and roboio_DelayUs() for time delay in 
    millisecond and microsecond, respectively. Add roboio_GetTick() to get the 
    current time ticks (unit: 1 millisecond) for counting time.

  + [by AAA] rewrite the [RB_BC_DOS] & [RB_MSVC_WINxx] part of timer_nowtime() 
    to allow a timer with 1ms precision in DOS Borland C++ 3.x~4.x & MSVC.
    
  + [by AAA] fix a bug of reporting wrong error messages in com_Init().

  + [by AAA] modify com_Close() to flush both write- & read-FIFO before closing 
    COM ports.

  + [by AAA] add the support of Towerpro SG90/SG5010 and Scanner STL-9894CTG 
    servos to RC Servo lib.


RoBoIO v1.81 (2011/7/19)
==========================

  + [by AAA & acen & Damien] in COM lib, disable the ISTRIP & PARMRK options 
    when enabling parity-checking in Linux; this fixes a bug that occurs when 
    using the half-duplex mode of COM lib with ODD/EVEN parity under Linux.
    
  + [by AAA] modify the Linux part of com_Send() & com_Receive() to handle 
    EINTR & EAGAIN errors.

  + [by AAA] modify com_ServoTRX() to report self-feedback errors only after 
    reading all self-feedback bytes.

  + [by AAA] add roboio_LibVer() to report the version of RoBoIO; e.g., for 
    ver 1.81, roboio_LibVer() will return 0x0181 and for the future ver 1.9, 
    roboio_LibVer() will return 0x0190.


RoBoIO v1.8 (2011/6/6)
========================

  + [by AAA & Josh] add software-simulated I2C functions into I2C lib. 
    The major feature of software-simulated I2C is that it allows to access 
    I2C sensors of LEGO NXT (such as LEGO NXT Ultrasonic Sensor), which 
    require an non-standard I2C protocol for communication.

    The software-simulated I2C functions assumes that your I2C slave devices 
    accept 3.3V input and there is only one master on I2C bus. For detailed 
    usages, please refer to RoBoIO introduction slides.
    
  + [by AAA & acen] implement the first complete COM lib for accessing 
    RoBoard's every native COM port (RB-110's FTDI serial ports aren't in 
    consideration). The issue for full-duplex & half-duplex (e.g., older 
    version of RB-100's COM4) is dealt with in COM lib automatically.
    
    Although RoBoard's native COM can be treated as standard serial ports in 
    various OS, we add the COM lib into RoBoIO so that one can write cross- 
    platform AI-servo control programs (e.g., access Dynamixel AX-12) more 
    easily. The principle is to provide only necessary API and make them as 
    simple as possible; if you need a serial-port lib with comprehensive 
    functions, you should select other popular libs in the PC platform.
    
    Currently, the new COM lib only supports WinXP/WinCE/Linux; the DOS 
    version (for DJGPP/Watcom C++/Borland C++ 3.0) still remains for future 
    implementation. For detailed usages of the new COM lib, please refer to 
    RoBoIO introduction slides.
    
  + [by AAA] modify I2C lib's functions that use the internal variables 
    "I2C_count" & "I2C_curAddr" to allow calling i2c0master_xxxxN() & 
    i2c1master_xxxxN() at the same time.

  + [by AAA] add some new servo models to rcservo_SetServo().

  + [by AAA] modify rcservo_PlayActionMix() to avoid underflow or overflow of 
    the fixed width.

  + [by AAA] add CPU & DRAM clock detection in io_Init(); add io_GetDRAMCLK() &
    io_GetCPUCLK() functions. Modify delay_us() in common.cpp to adopt 
    io_GetCPUCLK() for delay-time computation, and modify spi_Init2() to 
    adopt io_GetDRAMCLK() for SPI clock computation.

  + [by AAA] update every lib to support RoBoard RB-100RD.


RoBoIO v1.7 (2011/3/22)
=========================

  + [by AAA] update roboio_SetRBVer(), A/D lib, I2C lib, and PWM lib to support 
    RoBoard RB-050.

  + [by AAA] add i2c_SetResetPin() & i2c_ClearResetPin() to I2C lib for 
    controlling the ~Reset pin on the I2C connector of RB-110/RB-050.

    Add also i2c_Send(), i2c_Receive(), i2c_SensorRead, i2c_SensorReadEX() 
    to simplify the usage of I2C lib; see RoBoIO introduction slides for how to 
    use these functions.

  + [by AAA] add COM lib with com_EnableTurboMode() and com_DisableTurboMode() 
    to enable/disable the boosting mode of RB-110/RB-050's COM1 ~ COM4; see 
    RoBoIO introduction slides for how to use these functions.

  + [by AAA] add rcservo_SendPWM(), rcservo_SendCPWM(), rcservo_StopPWM(), 
    rcservo_CheckPWM() for the PWM mode of RC Servo lib. 

    Add some new servo models to rcservo_SetServo().
    
    Add rcservo_MoveOne() and rcservo_GetAction() for the Action Playing mode 
    of RC Servo lib; see RoBoIO introduction slides for how to use these 
    functions.
    
    Add rcservo_Init() to be an alias of the old rcservo_Initialize(); the 
    difference is that rcservo_Init() selects RCSERVO_SERVO_DEFAULT_NOFB as 
    default servo parameters.

    Rename the input parameters of rcservo_Init() to RCSERVO_USEPINS1, 
    RCSERVO_USEPINS2, ... to match the PWM pin names mentioned in "RoBoard 
    Hardware Introduction Slides"; add constants RCSERVO_PINS1, RCSERVO_PINS2, 
    ... to indicate the PWM pin in each single-channel function of RC Servo 
    lib.

    Add rcservo_SendCMD() in RC Servo lib's Capture Mode to send command pulses 
    (such as power-off pulse) to change behavior of a servo that supports such 
    pulses (e.g. KONDO KRS-788).

    Add rcservo_CapOne(), rcservo_CapAll() to simplify the Capture-Mode API 
    usage of RC Servo lib.

  + [by AAA] some functions are renamed or simplified so that they are more 
    user-friendly:
  
    Rename GPIO functions rcservo_Outp(), rcservo_Inp() of RC Servo lib as 
    rcservo_OutPin(), rcservo_InPin().
    
    Rename spi_Initialize(), spi_InitializeSW(), adc_Initialize(), 
    adc_InitializeMCH() as spi_Init(), spi_InitSW(), adc_Init(), adc_InitMCH().

    Add i2c_Init() to simplify the usage of i2c_Initialize() and 
    i2c0_SetSpeed().

    Add pwm_Init() to simplify the usage of pwm_Initialize().

    Rename old internal functions pwm_Initialize(), i2c_Initialize2() as 
    pwm_Init2(), i2c_Init2().

    Add internal function spi_Init2() to allow setting base address of SPI H/W 
    module.

    The compatibility issue has been considered, and thus old user codes for 
    RoBoIO 1.61 can still be compiled with the new version of RoBoIO.

  + [by AAA] update io_CpuID() to recognize Vortex86DX ver. C (PBA/PBB).

  + [by AAA] remove initial GPIO-output operations in i2c_Init2() to avoid 
    unexpected I2C device behaviors.
    
  + [by AAA] redefine error codes of AD79x8 lib as 5xx.

  + [by AAA] add roboio_CheckRBVer() for internal use. io_Init() now calls this 
    function to check the correct version of RoBoard.
    
  + [by AAA] fix a bug in rcservo.cpp & pwm.cpp that can cause wrong left-shift 
    operations when pwm_NumCh() >= 32.

  + [by AAA] rewrite rcservo_PlayAction() and rcservo_PlayActionMix() to avoid 
    possible bugs that can be caused when timer overflow occurs.
    
  + [by AAA] add io_outpcixx() and io_inpcixx() to I/O lib for accessing PCI 
    configuration space; note that currently for WinXP, only the version 
    compiled with the PciDebug or PhyMem library can provide thread-safe 
    PCI access.

  + [by AAA] add DOS Watcom C/C++ support.


RoBoIO v1.61 (2010/8/25)
==========================

  + [by AAA] fix a bug in io_CpuID() which makes RoBoIO not work on RB-110 with 
    STANDARD IDE enabled.

  + [by AAA] All usable functions of the A/D lib are renamed as adc_xxxx...; 
    see the new S/W introduction slide for reference.

    The compatibility issue has been considered, and thus old user codes for 
    RoBoIO 1.6 can still be compiled with the new version of RoBoIO.

  + [by AAA] add pwm_NumCh() to report available PWM channels in different 
    version of RoBoards.


RoBoIO v1.6 (2010/5/6)
========================
                                                                                
  + [by acen] Now RoBoIO supports both RoBoard RB-100 & RoBoard RB-110. Before 
    using any specific lib in RoBoIO, one must call roboio_SetRBVer() to set 
    the version of RoBoard so that the hardware features of different version 
    of RoBoards can be recognized correctly. (If roboio_SetRBVer() isn't 
    called, the default version will be RB-100.) See the following code for 
    an example.
    
    - usage example:

      /************************************************************************/

          #include <stdio.h>
          #include <roboard.h>
      
          int main(void) {
              int *val;

              roboio_SetRBVer(RB_110);  // set version of RoBoard = RB-110
              
              if (spi_Initialize(SPICLK_21400KHZ) == true)
              {
                  ......
                  ......
                  ......

      /************************************************************************/

  + [by acen] Add software-simulated SPI functions in SPI lib. It can generate 
    low-speed SPI clocks to communicate with low-speed SPI devices. It also 
    supports all of SPI clock modes (see 

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus
    
    for the information about SPI clock modes) and full-duplex data 
    transmission. To use the software-simulated SPI, one just calls 
    spi_InitializeSW() to initialize the SPI lib instead of spi_Initialize(); 
    then you can apply the old half-duplex spi_Read()/spi_Write() functions or 
    the new full-duplex spi_Exchange() function to access your SPI devices.

    - When calling spi_InitializeSW(), you use the following constant values 
      to determine the SPI clock mode:

          SPIMODE_CPOL0, SPIMODE_CPOL1
          SPIMODE_CPHA0, SPIMODE_CPHA1

      For example, if you want to select SPI clock mode <CPOL = 0, CPHA = 1>, 
      just pass SPIMODE_CPOL0 + SPIMODE_CPHA1 as the first argument of 
      spi_InitializeSW(). (Remarks: the SPI clock mode for the RoBoard's ADC 
      (AD7918) is <CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0>; if you want to apply software-simulated 
      SPI to access the ADC, please select the correct clock mode.)

    - spi_InitializeSW() allows a delay parameter (as its second argument) for 
      controlling the clock speed of the software-simulated SPI. The 
      approximate relation between the delay parameter and the clock speed is 
      listed as follows for reference:

       ----------------------------
¡@¡@¡@ |   Delay  |     Clock     |
       |----------+---------------|
       |    0     |    167 kHz    |
       |----------+---------------|
       |    2     |    100 kHz    |
       |----------+---------------|
       |    4     |     71 kHz    |
       |----------+---------------|
       |    6     |     56 kHz    |
       |----------+---------------|
       |    8     |     45 kHz    |
